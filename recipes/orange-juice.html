    <p>Fresh orange juice takes a little work, but it tastes much better than orange juice from concentrate. I came up with this recipe in response to a request about how to make fresh-squeezed orange juice. You may also use a citrus reamer to do this. If you want less pulp, use a hand juicer with a strainer.</p>
